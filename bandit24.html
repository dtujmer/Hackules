<h1>Bandit 24 --> Bandit 25</h1>

<p>"A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing."</p>

<h2>My solution</h2>

<p>After <code>ssh</code>ing to bandit24, I connected to <code>localhost</code> to see what was going on.</p>

<p><code>nc localhost 30002</code></p>

<p>This returns the following:</p>
<p><code>I am the pincode checker for user bandit25. Please enter the password for user bandit24 and the secret pincode on a single line, separated by a space.</code></p>

<p>Testing it with the password for this level + 0000, we get:</p>

<p><code>Wrong! Please enter the correct pincode. Try again.</code></p>

<p>And this repeats until you find the right 4-digit pincode. There are 10,000 possibilities here, so we need to automate that.</p>


<h2>Step 1</h2>

<p>Run this Python code to generate a file with the password and all possible pincodes.</p>

<p>
	<code><pre>
from itertools import product
n = '0123456789'
a = [''.join(i) for i in product(n, repeat=4)]
b = ['UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ ' + i for i in a]
f = open('passpin.txt', 'w')
f.write('\n'.join(b))
f.close()

	</pre></code>
</p>

<h2>Step 2</h2>

<p><code>ssh</code> into bandit24, create your directory in the <code>/tmp</code> directory, copy all the lines from passpin.txt into a new file. Then write the following script in your editor of choice, save it in your directory, and don't forget to <code>chmod</code> it to make it executable:</p>

<p><code><pre>
#!/bin/bash

while read line; do
	echo $line
	sleep 0.12
done < passpin.txt | nc localhost 30002 > /tmp/yourfolder/yourfile

</pre></code></p>

<p>The <code>sleep</code> command is necessary because the daemon is not instantly available all the time. After around 20 minutes, the script will have finished running, and then you just <code>grep bandit yourfile</code> and get: <code>The password of user bandit25 is uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG</code>.

<p>And that's it!</p>
