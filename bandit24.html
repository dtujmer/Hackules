<h1>Bandit 24 --> Bandit 25</h1>

<p>"A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing."</p>

<h2>My solution</h2>

<p>First, I connected to <code>localhost</code> to see what is going on.</p>

<code>nc localhost 30002</code>
